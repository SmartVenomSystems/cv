He is the classmate of Goku under Master Roshi's tutelage;[ch. 28] initially his rival but later a friend, and a loyal companion in adventures thereafter. He is killed by King Piccolo's spawn Tambourine, but later revived by Shenron.[ch. 135, 165] After the fight with the Saiyans, he travels to Planet Namek, where, after several battles, he is killed by Frieza.[ch. 317] After once again being brought back to life, this time by the Namekian Dragon Balls,[ch. 329] he helps out during the Android and Cell arcs.
