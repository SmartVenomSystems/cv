					Piccolo (ピッコロ, Pikkoro) is the spawn of King Piccolo, created to get revenge on Goku in the wake of his death, subsequently assuming the role as the "evil half" of Kami.[ch. 161, 165] However, after just narrowly being defeated by Goku, he has to team up with him and his friends when opposing the invading Saiyans, including training Goku's son Gohan.[ch. 193, 198, 205] He is later revealed to be a Namekian – a green-skinned, four-fingered, hairless humanoid species who created the series' titular Dragon Balls.[ch. 214] He dies sacrificing himself to protect Gohan during the fight against the Saiyan Nappa, and trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being wished back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls.[ch. 223, 261, 293] While during the fights with Frieza and the Androids he maintains the partnership temporarily, and by the time of the Cell and Majin Buu arcs he accepts the fact they are allies.
